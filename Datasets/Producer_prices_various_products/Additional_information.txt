The excel file contains the unchanged data downloaded directly from Eurostat (source: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/STS_INPPD_M/default/table?lang=en).
Sadly, Eurostat's description of said data is quite inconsistent constantly changing from 'producer prices' to 'output prices'. In the jupyter file I chose producer prices as an apt way to describe the data.

The jupyter notebook 'Producer_prices_various_products also contains the code for the creation of the 'data_merging_new' file.
